                    services and other Christian religious activities. We begin our church services with a ring of a bell.
                    The service usually involves the singing of hymns, reading of scripture verses and possibly a psalm,
                     and a sermon. If the church follows a lectionary, the sermon will often be about the scripture lections
                      assigned to that day.</p>

                <p class="text-muted" > A school library is a library within a school where students, staff, and often, parents of a
                public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is
                to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information,
                and to information technology. School libraries help students to get authentic information through the books written
                by reputed scholars who come from different parts of the world. A library plays an important role in 
                creating a school culture, which helps every student to grow on their individual basis as well. Researchers have
                demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies
                that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that
                students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist,
                scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted 
                in Ohio revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs
                 helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale in Australia
                in 2003.</p>

                <p class="text-muted" > A school auditorium is large room with rows of seats and often a stage which is used
                     for performances or meetings. It is used for all types of formal assembly: lectures, award ceremonies,
                      dramatic plays, musical theatre productions, concert performances of dance competitions and so on.
                       These varied events place a range of demands on the room. Basically it  is a room built to enable an audience
                        to hear and watch performances.</p>

                <p>I was completely shocked when I got to know that I have won the first prize in my Inter School debate on
                    environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time 
                    when I participated for the very first time so I did not secure any position in this competition,
                    At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I would do more hard work and I will participate
                    again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work
                    always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but
                    when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize,
                    My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known
                    that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>
